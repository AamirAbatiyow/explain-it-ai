    explanation: "The sky is blue because of a party trick called Rayleigh scattering! Sunlight is actually all the rainbow colors mixed together. When it hits our atmosphere, blue light bounces around way more than other colors because it has shorter waves. So we see blue everywhere! At sunset, light travels further and blue scatters away, leaving us with reds and oranges.",
